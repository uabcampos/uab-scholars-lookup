## Configuration

Each script has configurable parameters at the top:

- `DEPARTMENT`: Department name to search for (in department scripts)
- `RESEARCH_INTEREST`: Research interest substring to search for (in research interest script)
- `MAX_ID`: Upper bound on numeric user IDs to scan
- `WORKERS`: Number of threads to use for concurrent operations
- `PER_PAGE_*`: Page size for API calls (increased to 500 for better performance)
- `PAUSE`: Delay between API calls

## Usage

1. Pull data for a list of faculty:
```bash
python pull_master_scholars_by_faculty_list.py
```

2. Pull data for a specific user:
```bash
   python pull_scholar_profile_by_user_csvs.py
   ```

3. Search by department:
```bash
python search_by_department_concurrent.py
```

4. Pull all data for a department:
```bash
   python pull_master_scholars_by_dept_concurrent.py
   ```

5. Search by research interest:
   ```bash
   python search_by_research_interest.py
   ```
   - Edit the `RESEARCH_INTEREST` variable at the top of the script to set your search term.

## Recent Improvements

1. Reserved Key Conflict Resolved (type â†’ result_type):
   - In LLM environments like Open WebUI, "type" is often a reserved field that causes runtime errors.
   - All occurrences of "type" in JSON responses were renamed to "result_type".

2. Safer and More Consistent JSON Schema:
   - Responses are now better structured with:
     - result_type
     - status
     - message
     - results (always a list, even if empty)
     - error_details only when relevant
   - This prevents key mismatches and simplifies downstream handling by consumers (like LLMs or web apps).

3. Internal Method Error Guarding:
   - Methods that return data (_get_scholar_profile, _get_publications, etc.) now ensure that returned values are of the expected types.
   - This prevents cascading failures from bad API responses and makes the tool more robust in production.

4. Event Emission Fully Optional and Safe:
   - All _emit_* functions now silently skip emission if __event_emitter__ is None.
   - This avoids runtime errors when running standalone or outside of WebUI.

5. Async/Await Hygiene Improvements:
   - Cleaned up inconsistent await usage across internal and external methods.
   - This reduces unnecessary concurrency overhead and makes behavior more predictable.

6. Improved Error Reporting and Debug Output:
   - Enhanced error blocks now include:
     - "error_details" for debugging
     - "suggestion" fields for LLMs to suggest next steps
   - This improves UX for end users and AI agents.

7. Response Size Optimization:
   - Publication, grant, and teaching lists now return:
     - Just the first few most relevant items
     - Full counts in a total key
   - This keeps output manageable for LLM context limits and faster rendering.

8. Code Structure Simplified for Maintenance:
   - Removed redundancies across sync/async versions.
   - Modularized JSON response construction.
   - This makes future changes faster and safer.

## Troubleshooting

1. Empty CSVs:
   - Check if the faculty list or department name is correct
   - For research interest search, check if the search term is correct
   - Verify API access and rate limits
   - Check for network connectivity
   - Look for error messages in the console output

2. Name Matching Issues:
   - The scripts handle various name formats (nicknames, hyphenated names, Jr./Sr.)
   - If a faculty member is not found, try their full name or alternative name format
   - For research interest search, try alternative or broader search terms
   - Check the console output for name matching attempts

3. API Rate Limits:
   - The scripts include built-in delays between API calls
   - Adjust the `PAUSE` parameter if needed
   - Monitor the console output for rate limit errors

4. Network Issues:
   - The scripts now handle network timeouts gracefully
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify that the Scholars@UAB API is accessible
